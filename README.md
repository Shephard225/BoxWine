## 📌 About

**BoxWine** is an experimental project designed to run **Windows x86/x86_64 applications** on **Android** using **Termux**.

It combines **Wine**, **Box64 / Box86**, and multiple Linux and Android components into a single environment capable of running Windows software on ARM devices.

BoxWine is not a single emulator — it is a **complex compatibility stack**.

---

## 🧩 Core Components

BoxWine is built from many different components working together:

- **Wine (WoW64 / Wine64 / Wine32)** – Windows compatibility layer
- **Box64 / Box86** – x86/x64 to ARM translation
- **glibc-based environment** – improved Linux compatibility
- **Termux** – Linux userspace on Android
- **Termux-X11** – display server
- **Mesa (Zink / VirGL / Turnip)** – OpenGL & Vulkan translation
- **Vulkan Loader for Android**
- **PulseAudio** – sound support
- **Input Bridge** – touch, keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input

---

## 🖥️ Display & Graphics

- Display output is handled via **Termux-X11**
- Supports windowed and fullscreen modes
- Hardware acceleration depends on device and GPU
- Vulkan is supported on compatible devices
- Resolution is automatically detected, with fallback options

---

## 🎮 Controls & Input

BoxWine supports multiple input methods:

- Touchscreen controls
- Physical keyboard & mouse
- External gamepads
- **Input Bridge** for touch-to-keyboard/mouse mapping

Input Bridge is **required** for comfortable touch controls.

---

## 📱 Minimum System Requirements

> ⚠️ These are **minimum requirements**. Better hardware is strongly recommended.

- **SoC:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 655 or equivalent
- **CPU:** ARM64 (AArch64)
- **RAM:** 3 GB minimum (4 GB+ recommended)
- **Android:** Android 10 or newer
- **GPU:** Adreno with Vulkan support (recommended)
- **Storage:** 6–8 GB free space

Low-end devices may experience crashes or very poor performance.
